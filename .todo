GENERAL TODO:
    DONE ) On bicycle return, bicycle status is not being updated
        DONE ) Find bicycle from ticket property
        DONE ) update status
    DONE ) Check if program prevents user from borrowing a bicycle if he has debt
    DONE ) Check if program generates ticket codes automatically
    DONE ) Program doesn't ask for user ID, it generates it automatically based on user type

    ) Consider creating a superclass or interface for User and Bicycle, Ticket since they share common functionalities
        ) Like printing entries from a hashmap


    ) Change HashMaps that are for printing to LinkedHashMaps to preserve their order

    ) MenuStep for asking TicketCode & UserID can be turned into a method inside an interface implemented by bicylereturner and borrowerbicyle
